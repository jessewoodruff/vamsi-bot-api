At Annexus Health, we are a team of dedicated professionals with backgrounds in life sciences, healthcare software technology development, and the provider setting. While we approach our work from different angles, we are united by our commitment to reducing the administrative and logistical burdens across the patient journey in order to combat financial toxicity at both the patient level and the provider level. With this common goal in focus, our unparalleled relationships within the US healthcare market, and a development philosophy that emphasizes cycle-managing a problem rather than taking a task-based approach, we are able to rapidly develop and deploy solutions that have an immediate impact on the financial assistance cycle management process-and on the lives of patients.AssistPoint is a cloud based financial assistance program designed as a single enterprise workflow platform to help provider organizations navigate and manage the administrative patient access journey from end to end.  The Annexus Health Information Security Management and Privacy Program is implemented based on the security best practices outlined within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security frameworks and in alignment with HIPAA compliance. The program has been designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Annexus Health’s Information Systems and the data entrusted to us. The Information Security and Privacy Program and strategy is reviewed, updated, presented to and approved by the Executive Management team at least yearly. The program is risk-based and includes (but is not limited to) the following functions: • Development of organizational IT control standards, requirements, metrics, tests, and validation programs to promote, measure, and validate security in systems and services. • Development of controls surrounding Annexus Health’s information assets and technologies.  • Implement and monitor the effectiveness of those controls, with a goal of reducing overall risk. • Maintain an Information Security Risk Management Program to continually manage risk to/from internal and external threats. Identified findings are added to the risk register and corrective action plans (CAPs), remediation plans and/or additional analysis are created as needed. • Maintain and manage a secure infrastructure through appropriate review and oversight including monitoring and troubleshooting, for security related requests. • Raise awareness of technology related risks, vulnerabilities and protection requirements through security awareness materials and training programs. • Create, update, and maintain organizational policies, standards, processes, and procedures.  • Lead the analysis and testing of the control environment to achieve compliance for industry regulations such as HIPAA, HITRUST and SOC 2 controls. The Information Security and Privacy Program is designed to control risks identified through the risk assessment and evaluation of current safeguards. In light of fast-moving nature of Information Security, Privacy and Cybersecurity as well as threats, technologies, business conditions, regulatory obligations, and other factors, Annexus Health reserves the right, to update, revise or modify the Program more frequently. On an at least annual basis, Annexus Health conducts information security risk assessments designed to:• identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of company information;• assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats; and• assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures and other safeguards in place to control such risks.Patient Data is sent to Annexus to load into AssistPoint application via HL7 ADT format and is encrypted and configured to prioritize TLS 1.2 in transit. Data contained within the AssistPoint application is hosted and stored in MS Azure inside of an MS SQL Database which is encrypted utilizing AES 256. Data transfers may consist of lateral or bilateral means depending on the scope and specific requirements. Data classification requirements come into play whenever data is transferred internally or externally.  All data will be segregated and only accessible by the appropriate personnel identified by your organization and select Annexus Health personnel based on the model of least privilege and business need for support purposes.AssistPoint is hosted in the cloud utilizing Microsoft Azure services and is in a single Azure region across two availability zones.Data consumed by Annexus Health is stored as received in an Azure blob storage that is locked down and encrypted at rest. Data is stored, retained according to the contract and data retention schedules and policies.A confirmation of purged/destroyed data can be delivered when requested. The data destruction would follow the organizations record retention policy and schedules as related to Annexus Health's regulatory requirements.

Events are normalized across the cloud and delivered to existing SIEM or SOC infrastructure for analysis without requiring another “single pane of glass.”Data access monitoring to provide an immediate, comprehensive understanding of who has access to what data and why, whether they are employees, contractors or external third parties. This access modeling allows administrators and security personnel to understand why access has been granted, reducing time to remediation. Improper data exposure can be quickly detected and fixed before it leaks, with policies to monitor and prevent recurrence.Continuous security posture monitoring to manage configuration and vulnerabilities in critical SaaS applications across multiple deployments and clouds. Third party applications connected to SaaS platforms are detected, inventoried and monitored.

Events are normalized across the cloud and delivered to existing SIEM or SOC infrastructure for analysis without requiring another “single pane of glass.” Data access monitoring to provide an immediate, comprehensive understanding of who has access to what data and why, whether they are employees, contractors or external third parties. This access modeling allows administrators and security personnel to understand why access has been granted, reducing time to remediation. Improper data exposure can be quickly detected and fixed before it leaks, with policies to monitor and prevent recurrence. Continuous security posture monitoring to manage configuration and vulnerabilities in critical SaaS applications across multiple deployments and clouds. Third party applications connected to SaaS platforms are detected, inventoried and monitored. Sensitive configurations and administrator actions are monitored and audited to allow automatic remediation of configuration errors and enforce critical security controls. Security baseline requirements can be deployed across multiple instances of an application simultaneously. “Guardrails” can be put in place to allow rapid SaaS application development without sacrificing security or functionality.

Customer success drives our data center strategy and delivering the highest standard in availability, performance, and security is our top priority.

At any given time, a Salesforce instance is actively served from one location with transactions replicating in near real-time to a completely redundant, secondary location. We regularly site switch between the locations for maintenance, compliance, and disaster recovery purposes. As we continue to expand and improve our global infrastructure presence, we recommend customers build their applications free of specific data center requirements to support a seamless Salesforce experience.  We have nine Salesforce-managed data centers for the aforementioned services in the following metropolitan areas: - Chicago, Illinois, United States (USA) - Dallas, Texas, United States (USA) - Frankfurt, Germany (GER) - Kobe, Japan (JPN) - London, United Kingdom (UK) - Paris, France (FRA) - Phoenix, Arizona, United States (USA) - Tokyo, Japan (JPN) - Washington, DC, United States (USA)  In addition, we have a small number of instances served from Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud infrastructure in Canada and Australia.

By applying state of the art artificial intelligence and natural language processing, Aquant’s data-driven technology mines historical data and drives a reduction in machine downtime and improved first-time-fix rates.During the initial call, Aquant helps the Call Center Representative (CSR) to accurately identify the cause of the problem before sending the technician to the customer site by using guided questions. Aquant identifies the cause of the problem, provide potential solutions, their probabilities and the parts the technician should be equipped with to fix the problem on the first visit. When providing those recommendations, Aquant rank each one of the solutions according to the most cost-effective solution. This calculation entails the part cost, labor time and cost and the probability for each one of the optional solutions.To increase the remote resolution key performance indicator (KPI), Aquant highlights solutions that can be implemented by the customer without rolling a truck. The cost of this type of solutions is obviously the lowest for the service organization as the machine downtime is minimized and a truck roll is saved. Also, for every work order, Aquant predicts the likelihood of No Fault Found (NFF). Those are the cases where technicians go to the customer site and report back there was nothing wrong with the machine. The goal is to identify occasions where there is no problem with the machine, and therefore remote guidance will be sufficient to solve the problem.",a. GxP;f.

Secondary Purpose:  Provide J&J a solution for the Medical Device teams who do not have a system online to house material specifications (m-specs) to leverage the RS Tool as a database for storing in a data table format the material specifications derived from the Tech File reviews under the MDR initiative. The system was created as a short term solution.  The solution assists with the Chemical look up tool functionality to demonstrate compliance with Medical Device Regulation (MDR) program and to provide a comprehensive reference data on restricted substances to assess risk in J&J’s materials portfolio. Data is exported from PLM (product data from Tech Files) and ERP (part data from BOMs) systems and inputted manually into the RS tool. Restricted substances screening is done on the RS tool by Product Stewardship and the result of the screening is generated in a word format and stored in a SharePoint site for adding patient contact information as well justification for restricted subtances.
